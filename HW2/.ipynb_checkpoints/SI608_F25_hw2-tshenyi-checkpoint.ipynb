    "In Lab 3, we compared Lada’s Facebook network to a random network to examine whether it was a small world model.  We found that it was likely to be small-world, as it was different from the random model in certain ways: the clustering coefficient was greater and the average shortest path approximated ln(N). This analysis, however, does not tell us what kind of network model it actually is. For this, we need to generate different networks and compare them to the one we observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, we will be working with the **San Juan Sur Village dataset** which you worked with in HW1 Question 7. You again will need the file \"sj.gml\". This network data was collected by sociologists in 1948, who observed visiting patterns among families in the Costa Rican village San Juan Sur. Based on the number of visits, each household was assigned a “status score” ranging from 1 to 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly compare the San Juan Sur network to the possible network models, it's not enough to generate just one graph. With just one, we can’t be confident (in the statistical sense) whether we found a match: the chance that we get exactly the same thing is slim. Therefore, a better approach is to generate many (say, 200) different instances of the network and find the confidence intervals for the metric of interest (e.g., components, diameter, mean degree)."
